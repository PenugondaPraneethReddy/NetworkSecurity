# NetworkSecurity

Cloud storage gives us access to our files from anywhere simply by using an internet connection and eliminates the scope of hardware malfunction that is one of the most common causes for loss of data.

We have developed a web application that allows users to save their data on the cloud in a secure manner. The backend of the application has been coded using the Python programming Language and the frontend has been developed using HTML & CSS.
To develop the model we have used cryptography for providing data security which is currently the most popular technology being used for security purposes. To increase the security complexity a hybrid of three different encryption algorithms has been used each of which is used to encrypt a part of the divided file (simultaneously using multithreading). The selection of algorithm is done using the Round Robin mechanism. In addition to this we also use Digital signatures.

The application is scalable and can be designed in the future to allow the cloud environment to be associated with multiple users at the same time. This will enable people to collaborate over a common file â€“ thereby greatly improving work efficiency.
